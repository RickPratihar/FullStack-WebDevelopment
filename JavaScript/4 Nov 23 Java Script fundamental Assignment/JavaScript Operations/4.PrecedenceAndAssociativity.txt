Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these
concepts important?

Operator precedence and associativity are fundamental concepts in JavaScript and many other programming languages. They dictate the order in which operations are performed in an expression, which can significantly impact the result of the expression.

Operator Precedence refers to the order in which operations are performed when an expression is evaluated. Operators with higher precedence are executed before operators with lower precedence. For example, in the expression 2 + 3 * 4, the multiplication operation is performed first because it has higher precedence than addition. So the result is 2 + (3 * 4) = 14, not (2 + 3) * 4 = 20.

Operator Associativity comes into play when two or more operators with the same precedence appear in an expression. It dictates the direction in which the operations are performed. Operators can be either left-associative (left-to-right) or right-associative (right-to-left). For example, the subtraction operator (-) is left-associative, so the expression 10 - 5 - 2 is evaluated as (10 - 5) - 2 = 3, not 10 - (5 - 2) = 7.

Understanding these concepts is important because they can significantly impact the result of your code. If you're not aware of operator precedence and associativity, you might write expressions that don't behave as you expect, leading to bugs that can be difficult to track down. By understanding these concepts, you can write more accurate and predictable code.
