2.Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
each category.

In JavaScript, operators can be categorized based on their functionality into the following categories:

*Arithmetic Operators:
Examples:
Addition: let sum = 5 + 3;
Subtraction: let difference = 10 - 2;
Multiplication: let product = 4 * 6;
Division: let quotient = 20 / 5;
Modulus: let remainder = 15 % 4;

*Assignment Operators:
Examples:
Simple Assignment: let x = 10;
Addition Assignment: x += 5;
Subtraction Assignment: x -= 3;
Multiplication Assignment: x *= 2;
Division Assignment: x /= 4;

*Comparison Operators:
Examples:
Equal to: let isEqual = (5 == 5);
Not equal to: let isNotEqual = (10 != 5);
Greater than: let isGreater = (8 > 3);
Less than: let isLess = (2 < 7);
Greater than or equal to: let isGreaterOrEqual = (6 >= 6);
Less than or equal to: let isLessOrEqual = (4 <= 9);

*Logical Operators:
Examples:
Logical AND: let result = (true && false);
Logical OR: let result = (true || false);
Logical NOT: let result = !true;

*Bitwise Operators:
Examples:
Bitwise AND: let result = (5 & 3);
Bitwise OR: let result = (5 | 3);
Bitwise XOR: let result = (5 ^ 3);
Bitwise NOT: let result = ~5;
Left shift: let result = (5 << 2);
Right shift: let result = (5 >> 2);

*Unary Operators:
Examples:
Increment: let x = 5; x++;
Decrement: let y = 10; y--;
Unary plus: let num = +5;
Unary minus: let num = -10;

*Ternary Operator:
Example: let result = (condition) ? value1 : value2;
