3. Differentiate between unary, and binary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Unary operators are operators that take only one operand. They perform an operation on a single element. Examples of unary operators in JavaScript include:

Unary plus (+): Tries to convert the operand into a number.
Unary negation (-): Also tries to convert the operand into a number and negates after.
Logical not (!): Converts the operand to a boolean value and negates it.
Increment (++): Adds one to its operand.
Decrement (--): Subtracts one from its operand.
typeof: Returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.


Binary operators, on the other hand, are operators that take two operands. They perform an operation on two elements. Examples of binary operators in JavaScript include:

Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second.
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the first number by the second.
Less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), greater than or equal to (>=), equal to (==), not equal to (!=), strictly equal to (===), and strictly not equal to (!==): These are comparison operators that compare two values and return a boolean result.
