Q1. Explain the role of operators in javaScript.Why  are they  essential in programming?

Operators in JavaScript are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands (values or variables). They are essential in programming for several reasons:

*Performing Arithmetic Operations: Arithmetic operators like +, -, *, /, % are used to perform mathematical operations.

*Comparison: Comparison operators like ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= are used to compare values and return a boolean result.

*Logical Operations: Logical operators like &&, ||, ! are used to perform logical (AND, OR, NOT) operations.

*Assignment: Assignment operators like =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= are used to assign values to variables.

*Bitwise Operations: Bitwise operators like &, |, ^, ~, <<, >> are used to perform operations on binary representations of numbers.

*Other Operations: There are other operators like the ternary operator ? : for conditional expressions, typeof to get the type of a variable, instanceof to check if an object is an instance of a particular class or constructor, etc.

Without operators, we would have to write complex logic and functions to perform these basic operations, making programming more tedious and less efficient.
