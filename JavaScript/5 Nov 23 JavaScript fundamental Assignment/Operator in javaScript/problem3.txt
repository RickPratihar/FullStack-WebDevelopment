Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print
“positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.

Solution :
let num = 0;
let result = num > 0 ? "Positive" : num < 0 ? "Negative" : "Zero";
console.log("The number is: ", result);
// Output: The number is: Zero
// Here, we have used a nested ternary operator to check whether the number is positive, negative or zero.
// If the number is greater than 0, then it is positive, if it is less than 0, then it is negative, and if it is 0, then it is zero.
