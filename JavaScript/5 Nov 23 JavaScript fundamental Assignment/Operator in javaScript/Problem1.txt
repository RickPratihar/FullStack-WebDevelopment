Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even
or odd using the ternary operator.

Explain the use of ternary operator : Ternary operator is used to test the conditions similar to that of an if else block. It has three operands: condition,
statement if condition is true and statement if condition will be false.

let result = num % 2 == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";
console.log("The number is: ", result);
